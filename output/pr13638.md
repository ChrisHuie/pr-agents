## AI-Generated Summaries

### Executive Summary
Added automated npm dependency update configuration to Prebid.js, enabling weekly checks for package updates while preventing potentially breaking major version changes to maintain platform stability.

### Product Manager Summary
Configured Dependabot to automatically manage npm package dependencies for Prebid.js with weekly update checks. The configuration uses an "increase" versioning strategy and explicitly ignores major version updates to prevent breaking changes. This ensures the project stays current with security patches and minor improvements while maintaining backward compatibility. The change complements existing GitHub Actions dependency management, creating a comprehensive automated dependency update system.

### Developer Summary
Extended .github/dependabot.yml to include npm ecosystem configuration alongside existing GitHub Actions setup. Added 8 lines configuring: package-ecosystem "npm" targeting root directory, weekly schedule matching GitHub Actions cadence, versioning-strategy set to "increase" for incremental updates, and ignore rule blocking all major version updates (version-update:semver-major). Configuration ensures automated dependency updates for security and bug fixes while preventing breaking changes that could impact the extensive Prebid.js adapter ecosystem. Note: Initial PR included versioning-strategy at wrong indentation level, which failed GitHub validation and was corrected before merge.

### Reviewer Summary
Straightforward Dependabot configuration addition with proper npm ecosystem setup. Initial submission had incorrect YAML indentation for versioning-strategy (fixed during review). Configuration appropriately blocks major updates to prevent breaking changes across Prebid's large adapter ecosystem. Weekly schedule aligns with existing GitHub Actions updates. Consider documenting the rationale for "increase" strategy vs "auto" in team docs.

### QA/Tester Summary
Configuration change only - no functional testing required. Verify Dependabot creates PRs for npm dependencies after merge by checking Actions tab for scheduled runs. Ensure created PRs respect ignore rules (no major version bumps) and follow increase strategy. Monitor first few automated PRs to confirm they don't propose breaking changes. No impact on existing Prebid.js functionality or test suites.

## Review Discussion

The PR had an initial issue with YAML formatting where the `versioning-strategy` was at the wrong indentation level. This caused GitHub's validation to fail. The reviewer (dgirardi) provided a suggestion to fix the indentation, which was acknowledged by the author who noted the validation failure. After the discussion, the PR was approved and merged.

## Recommendations

1. Document the choice of "increase" versioning strategy in team documentation
2. Consider adding a comment in the YAML explaining why major versions are ignored
3. Monitor initial Dependabot PRs to ensure configuration works as expected
4. Consider setting up auto-merge for patch-level security updates
5. Document the dependency update policy for the team

## Conclusion

This is a low-risk infrastructure improvement that enhances the project's dependency management capabilities. By adding npm to Dependabot's automated updates while carefully controlling version bumps, the team can maintain security and stability without manual dependency tracking. The configuration aligns well with Prebid.js's need for stability given its extensive ecosystem of adapters and integrations.
