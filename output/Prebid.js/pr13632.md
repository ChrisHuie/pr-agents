### Technical Developer Summary
This pull request addresses a TypeScript type error in the `targetingControls.allowTargetingKeys` typing within the `src` directory of Prebid.js.  The change involves a modification of the existing type definition to correct an incompatibility.  Specifically, the fix involves adjusting the type definition to accurately reflect the expected structure of the `allowTargetingKeys` property. No new classes, modules, or libraries were introduced. The implementation is straightforward, focusing on correcting the type definition to resolve the reported TypeScript error.  No performance implications are anticipated, and no security considerations are relevant to this specific type correction.  Test coverage was likely updated to reflect the change in type definition, although the exact testing approach is not specified in the provided context.  No new dependencies were added.

### Code Review
This PR addresses a TypeScript typing error in `targetingControls.allowTargetingKeys`.  The changes are minor (3 lines added, 3 lines deleted) and limited to a single file, suggesting low risk. Reviewers should carefully examine the type correction for correctness and potential ripple effects on other parts of the `targetingControls` module.  Ensure the fix doesn't introduce regressions or break existing functionality.  Verify that existing unit tests adequately cover the corrected code and consider adding a new test case specifically targeting this fix if needed.  Finally, confirm adherence to Prebid.js's coding style guidelines.
