## Overview

This PR fixes a critical currency handling bug in the VIS.X adapter for Prebid Server (Go version). The adapter was not properly relaying the currency from VIS.X bid responses, causing all bids to default to USD regardless of the actual currency. The fix ensures proper multi-currency support by extracting and passing through the currency field from the VIS.X response.

## AI-Generated Summaries

### Executive Summary
Fixed currency handling bug in VIS.X adapter where all bids defaulted to USD, now properly supports multi-currency bidding by relaying the actual currency from VIS.X responses, ensuring accurate financial transactions in international markets.

### Product Manager Summary
Resolved a critical issue where the VIS.X adapter in Prebid Server wasn't passing bid currencies from the VIS.X platform, causing all bids to default to USD. This fix enables proper multi-currency support, allowing publishers to receive bids in EUR, GBP, and other currencies as intended. The change includes comprehensive test updates across 9 test scenarios and a minor version bump in the adapter configuration. This ensures accurate revenue reporting and proper bid competition across different currency zones, particularly important for European and international publishers using VIS.X demand.

### Developer Summary
Added currency relay functionality to the VIS.X adapter by introducing a `Cur string` field to the `visxResponse` struct and implementing conditional currency assignment in the `MakeBids` method. The fix checks if `bidResp.Cur` is non-empty and assigns it to `bidResponse.Currency`, ensuring proper currency propagation from VIS.X responses. Updated 9 test fixtures to reflect the actual API response format where currency is a string rather than an array. Also bumped the wrapper version in visx.yaml from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2 to indicate API compatibility changes. Implementation follows Go idioms with minimal code addition (6 lines) and maintains backward compatibility by only setting currency when present in the response.

### Reviewer Summary
Clean, focused fix for currency handling in VIS.X adapter. Code changes are minimal and follow existing patterns. Good test coverage with 9 test files updated to match actual API format. Consider adding a test case specifically for missing/empty currency field to ensure graceful handling. The wrapper version bump in YAML config properly signals the change. No breaking changes or performance impacts. Approved by two reviewers over a month-long review period.

### QA/Tester Summary
Test scenarios should verify: 1) Bids with EUR, GBP, and other non-USD currencies are properly preserved, 2) Missing currency field doesn't cause errors (graceful degradation), 3) Empty currency string is handled correctly, 4) Integration with currency conversion modules works as expected. All 9 existing test cases have been updated to reflect the new string format for currency. Regression testing should focus on VIS.X bid responses and downstream currency handling in bid adjustments and analytics modules. No impact on other adapters.

## Technical Details

### Currency Handling Implementation
```go
// Added to visxResponse struct
Cur string `json:"cur,omitempty"`

// Added to MakeBids method
if bidResp.Cur != "" {
    bidResponse.Currency = bidResp.Cur
}
```

### Test Format Change
All test files updated from:
```json
"cur": ["USD"]  // Old array format
```
To:
```json
"cur": "USD"    // New string format
```

## Recommendations

1. Add explicit test case for empty/missing currency scenarios
2. Document the currency format change in adapter documentation
3. Consider adding currency validation to ensure ISO 4217 compliance
4. Update VIS.X adapter documentation with supported currencies
5. Monitor adapter performance post-deployment for any currency-related issues

## Conclusion

This is a well-executed bug fix that addresses a significant issue in multi-currency support for the VIS.X adapter. The implementation is clean, minimal, and includes comprehensive test updates. The long review period (37 days) suggests thorough testing and validation. The fix is critical for publishers operating in non-USD markets and ensures accurate bid pricing across different currencies.
