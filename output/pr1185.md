## AI-Generated Summaries

### Executive Summary
Added Swift Package Manager support to Prebid Mobile iOS demo app, enabling modern dependency management alongside existing CocoaPods support, reducing friction for developers adopting Prebid Mobile SDK in iOS projects using SPM.

### Product Manager Summary
Introduced Swift Package Manager (SPM) support to the Prebid Mobile iOS demo application through a new PrebidDemoSPM target. This enhancement addresses developer demand for SPM integration, as it's Apple's official package manager and increasingly preferred over CocoaPods. The implementation maintains backward compatibility by keeping the existing CocoaPods setup intact while adding SPM as an alternative. This dual-support approach allows developers to choose their preferred dependency management tool, potentially increasing SDK adoption among teams that have standardized on SPM. The change impacts only the demo app, not the core SDK, serving as a reference implementation for SPM integration.

### Developer Summary
Created a new Xcode target `PrebidDemoSPM` that uses Swift Package Manager for dependency resolution instead of CocoaPods. The implementation involves significant project.pbxproj modifications (335 lines) to configure the new target with proper build settings, frameworks, and package dependencies. Updated 18 Objective-C test files to use `@import` module syntax instead of framework imports, ensuring compatibility with both dependency managers. Added SPM package references for PrebidMobile, PrebidMobileAdMobAdapters, PrebidMobileGAMEventHandlers, PrebidMobileMAXAdapters, and GoogleInteractiveMediaAds. The new target shares the same source files as the original demo app but uses SPM's dependency resolution. No changes to actual demo functionality - purely build system modifications.

### Reviewer Summary
Clean implementation of SPM support with minimal risk to existing functionality. Project file changes are extensive but well-structured, following standard SPM integration patterns. Good decision to create a separate target rather than replacing CocoaPods entirely. Import statement updates in test files are appropriate for module compatibility. Consider adding documentation about building with SPM vs CocoaPods in the README. Verify all demo features work correctly with the SPM target. The 2-day review cycle suggests thorough testing was performed.

### QA/Tester Summary
Test both PrebidDemoSPM (new) and PrebidDemoSwift (existing) targets to ensure feature parity. Key areas: 1) Build and run both targets on various iOS versions, 2) Verify all ad formats work identically (banner, interstitial, native, video), 3) Test adapter integrations (AdMob, GAM, MAX) function properly with SPM dependencies, 4) Validate no regression in existing CocoaPods-based target, 5) Check Xcode's package resolution completes successfully, 6) Test clean builds and incremental builds. No functional changes expected - focus on build system and dependency resolution differences.

- **Comments:** 4
- **Review Duration:** 2 days
- **Approved By:** bretg, jsligh
- **Review Highlights:**
  - Initial request to rename target from PrebidDemoSPM to PrebidDemo

  - Discussion about naming conventions

## Technical Implementation Details

### SPM Package Configuration
```swift
// Package dependencies added:
.package(url: "https://github.com/prebid/prebid-mobile-ios")
.package(url: "https://github.com/googleads/swift-package-manager-google-interactive-media-ads-ios")
```

### Import Migration Pattern
```objc
// Before (CocoaPods):
#import <PrebidMobile/PrebidMobile.h>

// After (SPM compatible):
@import PrebidMobile;
```

### Build Configuration
- New Info.plist: `PrebidDemoSPM-Info.plist`
- Shared source files between targets
- Separate framework linking for SPM

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive guide for building with SPM in project README
2. **CI/CD**: Update CI pipelines to build and test both targets
3. **Migration Guide**: Create documentation for developers migrating from CocoaPods to SPM
4. **Version Pinning**: Consider adding specific version requirements for SPM dependencies
5. **Sample Code**: Update sample integration code to show both CocoaPods and SPM setups
6. **Testing**: Implement automated tests to ensure feature parity between targets

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts
- Modernizes the project with Apple's official package manager
- Reduces dependency on third-party tools (CocoaPods)
- Faster build times with SPM's efficient caching
- Better Xcode integration and Apple platform alignment
- Easier for new developers already familiar with SPM

### Considerations
- Increases project complexity with dual dependency management
- Requires maintaining two build configurations
- May need additional documentation and support
- CI/CD systems need updates to test both paths

## Conclusion

This PR successfully adds Swift Package Manager support to the Prebid Mobile iOS demo app without disrupting existing CocoaPods functionality. The implementation is clean and follows iOS development best practices. While the PR description could have been more detailed, the code changes are well-structured and the dual-support approach provides flexibility for developers with different toolchain preferences. This modernization step aligns with Apple's ecosystem direction and should improve developer adoption of the Prebid Mobile SDK.
